 - glow_paper: All the figures in the GLoW paper can be reproduced with
               the scripts in this folder. Note: PL_approx_plot.py will
               take around an hour to run. This long execution time is
               due to the computation of Fw with mpmath, once the data
               is computed the script will save it and load it in later
               runs. If you cannot compute it and need the data please
               contact us.
